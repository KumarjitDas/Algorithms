## Description

My programming journey began a few years ago when I started college. I
learned *C*, *Java*, *Python*, other technologies, learned software
development, algorithms and data structures throughout my college life. This
project has all the algorithms I have ever learned and still learning. It
contains the implementations of different algorithms in *Python*, *Java*, and
*C* programming languages.

I will continue updating this repository by adding more algorithms.

The list of algorithms implemented till now is given in
[Project Status](#project-status).

## Installation

In this project, three different languages have been used to implement
different algorithms. You will need a **Python** interpreter, **Java**
development environment, and a **C** compiler. In my system (Windows 10), I
am using **Python 3.9** interpreter, **Java 1.8** (*Javac version 16*), and
*clang* as **C** compiler.

To get started with this project, download and install the following.

- Download and install **git**
  - If you use *Windows*, then go to [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    and download and install the suitable version.
  - If you use any stable version of *Debian/Ubuntu* then run this command in
    your terminal

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```

  - If you use *macOS* then install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't
    already have it, then run this command in your terminal

    ```sh
    brew install git
    ```

- Run the command to clone this repository

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/KumarjitDas/Algorithms.git
  ```

- Download and install **Python 3.9**.
  - If you use *Windows 10* then download and install **Python 3.9** from
    [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) link.
  - If you use any stable version of *Debian/Ubuntu* then run this command in
    your terminal

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install python3.9
    ```

  - If you use *macOS* then run this command in your terminal

    ```sh
    brew install python
    ```

- Download and install **Java Runtime Environment** (*jre*) and
  **Java Development Kit** (*jdk*).
  - If you use *Windows 10* then download and install **Java** from
    [this](https://www.java.com/en/download/) link.
  - If you use any stable version of *Debian/Ubuntu* then run these commands in
    your terminal

    ```sh
    sudo apt install default-jre
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo apt install default-jdk
    ```

  - If you use *macOS* then run these commands in your terminal

    ```sh
    brew cask install java
    ```

    ```sh
    brew install openjdk@8
    ```

- Download and install a **C** compiler (*clang* or *gcc*).
  - If you use *Windows 10* then download and install a suitable version of
    **clang** from [this](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) link. For
    **gcc**, use the suitable *MinGW* version from
    [this](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download) link.
  - If you use any stable version of *Debian/Ubuntu* then run these commands in
    your terminal to download and install **clang** and **gcc** compilers

    ```sh
    sudo apt install clang
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo apt install gcc
    ```

  - In *macOS*, **clang** is the default **C** compiler. To download and
    install gcc, run this command in your terminal

    ```sh
    brew install gcc
    ```

## Usage

There is no specific usage guidelines as this project only contains examples
of different algorithms implemented in *Python*, *Java*, and *C* programming
languages.

Use the examples of this project for references.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/KumarjitDas/Algorithms/issues) for a
list of proposed algorithms (and known issues).

The list of algorithms implemented till now is given in
[Project Status](#project-status).
